 * Bare-bones Nintendo Wiimote library for Arduino, tricking the Wiimote into

 *
 * Using insights into the communication between Wiimote and Nunchuk found
 * at http://www.ccsinfo.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=91094.  The wmgui tool that
 * comes with cwiid is good for experimenting and testing.
 *
 * Here's how to connect the Arduino to the Wiimote:
 *      Arduino    Wiimote
 *      GND        GND  (white cable)
 *      AREF       3.3V (red cable)
 *      A4         SDA  (green cable)
 *      A5         SCL  (yellow cable)
 *
 * It doesn't look like it's possible to power the Arduino from the Wiimote.
 *
 * Note that some online instructions for using a Wiimote extension
 * with Arduino call for changes to twi.h.
 * Fortunately, this modification is no longer
 * necessary.  Just use a current version of the Arduino development
 * environment.
